5. Filter options eg. by alphabet, time, name, etc 
6. Select labs
7. Resizeable schedule, can hide it etc
8. Links to specific class pages
9. Make it so class selections are saved if navigating to [contribute] page for example
    - also the terms as well
        - maybe can save as cookie so even if user leaves page it comes back?
## Optimizations
1. More contexts? 
2. Dont want prop drilling for search handleUpdate()

4. Duplication b/w index.js/mainComponent.js and share/[id].js
