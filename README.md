# Dalhousie Timetable Helper

I have created a tool to help with picking classes at Dalhousie.
It supports searching / filtering classes (which the academic timetable does not)

## Feature support
- Searching by name, CRN, time or department
- Sharing a selection of class(es) with friends via a link

## Planned features
- Make it look much better
- Improve responsiveness so that it works properly on phones
- Search by location / professor
- Add the ability to compare schedules with your friends in a 'compare' mode


## Bugs to fix
- Class names not fitting properly within class 'box'

## Dependancies
Dependancies are incomplete. Planning to fix later

### API
- Python 3
- Flask, Flask CORS
- MySQL / MariaDB

### Website
- React
- React router
