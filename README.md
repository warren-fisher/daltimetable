# Dalhousie Timetable Helper

I have created a tool to help with picking classes at Dalhousie.
It supports searching / filtering classes (which the academic timetable does not)

## Feature support
- Searching by name, course registration number, time, department and days of the week the course occurs
- Sharing a selection of class(es) with friends via a link

## Planned features
- Ability to remove class from selection (without searching for it again)
- Make it look much better
- Improve responsiveness so that it is usable on a wider range of devices
- Search by location / professor
- Add the ability to compare schedules with your friends in a 'compare' mode

## Bugs to fix
- Class names not fitting properly within class 'box'
- Responsiveness
- Accessibility of the time display table (perhaps not possible)
- When viewing a share link classes are not drawn immediately (sometimes, cant reproduce)

## Dependancies
Dependancies are incomplete. Planning to fix later
